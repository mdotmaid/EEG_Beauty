# EEG_Beauty
Made for Lara's Thesis
I'm using GitHub for the first time because I'm told it makes coding life a LOT easier for everyone involved.
Cross your fingers!

Important Notes:
1) You need to have 'eeglab13_5_4b' in the same folder as everything else
2) Right now, it's set up to run Subjects 826 and 1734. Their .cnt files should be in a folder called "CNT" that's in the same directory as everything else
3) Order for Minimal Working Example:
    (i)   RUN_ME_FIRST;
    (ii)  script_process_cnt;
    (iii) view_data;
